# Road Safety Analysis
## PART 1 Project Overview & Environment Setting
### **Project Overview**
**Background** <br>
Over the last five years, fatalities resulting from vehicle accidents on Syracuse streets have risen by over 70%. Also, incidents involving severe injuries from crashes have seen a 12% increase on the street in Syracuse during the same timeframe.
<br>
<br>
**Business Objective** <br>
Considering the background mentioned above, the business objective in this project is to minimize the occurrence of vehicle-related accidents on Syracuse streets, thereby reducing both severe injuries and fatalities.
<br>
<br>
**Project Goal** <br>
The goal of this project is to decipher the intricate relationship between various factors by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques in order to provide the solutions of the business objective.
<br>
<br>
**Predictions** <br>
Through the project, we will answer the following questions (predictions).
1. *Can we predict the time of that day of accidents, given the road information, weather, etc?*
2. *Can we predict the event type based on time, road condtions, or weather conditions?*
3. *Are there any specific patterns in accidents during certain weather, lighting, or road surface conditions?*
4. *Are there distinct groups or clusters of accidents based on similar conditions?*
5. *Can we identify anomalies or outliers in accident occurrences based on the collected attributes?*

### **Environment Setting**
Before the research, this step is for setting up the environment for analysis and modeling. The main module we used in the project is PySpark. <br>
